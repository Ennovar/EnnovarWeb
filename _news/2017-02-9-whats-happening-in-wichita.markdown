Groundwork, an initiative of Chris Callen and Builders Plus, provides a collaborative working environment for early stage startups.

The Pitches and Pints competition provided early stage companies a chance to give their pitch for a shot at a spot at Groundwork. Runners-up were Mobile Car Tune, which provides "come-to-you" automotive maintenance services like oil changes, and Proto Bench, which provides prototyping services.

▪ Grit Virtual Construction debuted. Grit will leverage virtual reality renderings to introduce cost and time efficiencies and customization effectiveness into the construction process.

▪ Janssens Dynamic launched a new version of its augmented reality app VoyeuR that converts 2-D to 3-D.

▪ Wichita eSports Convention and ICT Game Jam hosted by Wichita eSports were a smashing success as esports continues to hit the mainstream.

Zenith esports won the $15,000 prize pool League of Legends Tournament, and PZT9 took first place in the $4,000 prize pool CS:GO Tournament.

The game "Super BLT" developed by Kelly Ray J during the event was selected by the judges and community as the winner of the Game Jam.
